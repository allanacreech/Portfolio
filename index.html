				Surf our Landing Pages. Once you want to look at the dashboard click the login in the navigation bar. Sign up for your account. It will then ask you to log in with your account information. Then re-enter this information and click to login.	 
				</p>
				<p>
				When our team discussed the need to help capture lost alumni through online networking, we realized universities were letting a critical asset, its alumni foundation, leave campus after graduation without maintaining a connection to the college, school, or charter community.	
				</p>
				<p>Seeing that the alumni are a key asset it is clear that we not need to neglect this group. Allow the members of the community to reach accross the street or world with a few clicks of a mouse can make all the difference.	Alumni referrals have been known to help dozens of new students find their way to the university, led others to job referrals, and it helps the professional commuinity search outside of social media apps to look for their own niche.

				<p>
					Flaming along the MVC design pattern this fun little page uses Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app. Which then allows Handlebars to genterate the HTML content page. EAT-Da-Burger! is a fun resturant app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a user submits a burgers name the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be Devoured. Once clicking the Devour It! button the burger will move to the right to be displayed.
